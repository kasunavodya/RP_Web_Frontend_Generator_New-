UI Builder - Design and develop UI with automatic code generation.

**Main objective**
Making the software development process simple, efficient, and robust.
A tool that can generate complete working source code with embedded business logic

**Main Research questions**
* The main problem in the research is the UI designers, software engineers are unable to design the UI templates according to their preference.
* The users are unable to preview a live display of the UI templates.
* Designers and software engineers need to spend more effort & time to finalize UI preferred by end user.
* Non-technical people cannot use the UI designing tools currently in the market.
* Unable to develop front end code for the both mobile and web UI templates.
* Unable to develop the backend code along with the database from current tools in the market.
